## Issues Faced and Solutions
1. User Interface Consistency
   - Challenge:
        It was hard to keep the design of the app looking the same everywhere. Different parts had slightly different colors, spacing, and styles, which made it look messy.

    -Solution:
        I fixed this by using a common set of colors and spacing through variables. This made the whole app look more consistent and easier to manage.

2. Responsive Layout Issues
    -Challenge:
        The layout didnâ€™t look good on smaller screens. Some elements were overlapping or not showing properly.

    -Solution:
        I used media queries and made the layout responsive. Now it adjusts automatically based on screen size and works well on all devices.

## Additional Features
1. Implemented persistent storage.
2. Implemented light and dark theme.
3. Implemented search and filter functionality for the user table.
4. Implemented functionality to export user data.
